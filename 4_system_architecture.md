### Chapter 4, system architecture



In here we tried to give you a view of how our system database will be. Though it is not the final version we built and more improvement will be done to this soon. As you have seen the diagram the Admin panel has the access of all the databases. So at anytime an admin can add or delete any user or remove their history. This account is used for solving bugs or further improvements.

As you can also see there is a teachers section by which teacher can only see his courses and the students attendance percentages. Also teacher can send notification to specific student if he want  and it will be shown that specific studentâ€™s notification.

And last section is the student section or the user. Here the students can see their enrolled courses and attendance percentages and notification about class.

### Databases :

We made here couple of databases as well like Class, Students, Teachers, Group, Course etc to keep the data store in specific section.
