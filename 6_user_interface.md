### User interface

* In our very first sketch we think about the application on a mobile platform. We also have initial ideas for the application to work on computers and other devices; this way the student doesn't have to worry about his attendence. But if everyone had a smartphone, our planned application would be simpler to develop without a doubt.
 
 Here are some sketches so that people can get a rough idea about our project

##### Design of UI

The User must connect to the school intranet in order to log in and he/she will get all the necessary info there. On the homepage, there is a time clock which will tell users their next class (name, place and an indoor map), which helps the student find his class. Because of the school's network and its internal positioning system, we would try to make the map as perfect as possible. We also thought about a voice navigation system that would guide students inside the school much like a GPS. According to our documentation, every student could see their upcoming classes through the mobile app. The app would also contain the student's attendence records, so that he/she could track their performance. The application would inform the student if they were missing classes more often than average.

##### Navigation

As for the indoor navigation, an accurate beacon is our first priority (the beacon would ideally be accurate to within a meter). In order to track students more accurately, our plan was to implement a jammer-based system. This would essentially work as a strong network hub, allowing only a single network within its range and prevent other similar signals from interfering. This means that when a student enters a class, the jammer locates him/her based on their positioning signal and will only give access to one network.
