### User interface

* On our very first sketch we think about it on mobile platform.We have also plan for computer and other devices so that the student shouldn't be worry about his attendence.But if he has a smartphone then it will be more beneficiable for them no doubt.
* here are some sketches so that people can get a rough idea about our project

* The User must have to connect the school intranet to log in and he/she will get all the necessary info there.In home page there is a time clock which will constantly tell them about their next class name and place and a indoor map which helps the student find his class inside of his school.Because of school's internal network connection and door to door beacon we will try to make the map as perfect so that it can even differentiate every meter.In adission we also though about voice navigation system as well.
 

* this is not about appearance or design itself (although nice design might help to understand things or ideas)
* provide also the navigational structure / relations between the views, that is, to which view you can go another one
