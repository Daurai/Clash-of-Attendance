### User interface

* describe here what kind of views are there
* a view: a specific screen that the end user sees
* description is from logical perspective: what features are provided on a specific view
* this is not about appearance or design itself (although nice design might help to understand things or ideas)
* provide also the navigational structure / relations between the views, that is, to which view you can go another one
