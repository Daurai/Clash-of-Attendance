### User interface

* On our very first sketch we think about it on mobile platform.We have also plan for computer and other devices so that the student shouldn't be worry about his attendence.But if he has a smartphone then it will be more beneficiable for them no doubt.
 
 Here are some sketches so that people can get a rough idea about our project

##### Design of UI

The User must have to connect the school intranet to log in and he/she will get all the necessary info there.In home page there is a time clock which will constantly tell them about their next class name and place and a indoor map which helps the student find his class inside of his school.Because of school's internal network connection and door to door beacon we will try to make the map as perfect so that it can even differentiate every meter.In adission we also though about voice navigation system as well.Also student can see their upcomming classes though the mobile app and his own attendence records so that he can track himself as well.Also if he missing classes more often the notification system will now and then notifies the student about his bunks.
 

##### Navigation

For indoor navigation a beacon is our first priority so that it will locate the student every meter by meter.We all know in school and universities every room represent every class.So to locate the student more accurately we are trying to implement a jammer based system.Jammer system is actually a strong network hub allowing only a single network on it's range and prevent other similar signal on it's mother network.So basically when a student enter a class the jammer system locates him/her with his gps signal and will provide that specific class network though it is a part of school's own secure connection.
