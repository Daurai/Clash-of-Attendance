### Chapter 2: Introduction

#### Background and overview

Our idea for this project was simply the result of the fastest brainstorming session any of us had ever been a part of. We all likes games (to some degree) and have all read articles and studies on how teachers are trying to change an outdated education system via "gamification" (i.e. making something into a game-like experience). We thought that we could combine that concept with the enforced requirement of indoor-positioning. All in all, the positioning system fit into our existing idea extremely well.

We don't feel like there's a definite "need" for our system, but it's more a question of whether something could potentially be improved with a new application. Our thinking is that attendance and student interaction in class could be changed with our application, and by additional incentives (bribes, really).

#### System description

Our system is an application for smartphones that would collect points for each student based on their attendance. The application would log the student's attendance based on proximity to a nearby indoor-positioning system. A student would use the application with their Metropolia user credentials, and the application would only award points to the student for courses they are enrolled on. Students could also be issued challenges by teachers for additional points. Top scorers of each class could be awarded cafeteria vouchers or something similar to that. Rewards to be determined.

#### Special notes

For investment reasons, existing infrastructure such as wifi could be used for this (even if it isn't the most accurate system available).
