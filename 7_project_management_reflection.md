### Chapter 7: Project management and reflections

#### Summary

All in all, we started out with a very clear plan for our project during the very first meeting. I think we must have only spent an hour or two meeting in person, and the rest of our communication happened on Facebook or other IM services. We kept hashing out the initial plan that we started with, and I think we all realized very shortly that us university students weren't the right age bracket for what we were planning. Our system would be more successful among younger people, such as grade or middle schoolers. Even so, there are measures that we took to steer away from our initial game-oriented plan into a more...incentive-focused application.

#### Next project

Our communication and ideas for this project were quite good, so the main thing we would have to work on for the next project would be our time management. For the next project we would have to set ourselves a clearer timetable and keep to it better than we did this time around.

#### The easy and the hard



#### Hours

Joni Sarjosalo: 4-5 hours.
