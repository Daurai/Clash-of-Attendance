### Chapter 3: Use Cases and User Flow

#### 1. Students 

Students are the primary user group of our application. They will use the software to gain points based on attendance and challenge completion (as awarded by the indoor-positioning system that tracks their attendance. They can also spend points to improve their keep. Special rewards would be awarded to the highest-performing students (get an exam question or topic beforehand etc.).

Note that the login to the application would be different if used in the classroom, as classroom mode would automatically log in every student with the correct privileges that happened to stay close enough to the indoor beacon.

#### 2. Teachers 

Teachers can use the software to track students' participation in the game, assign challenges, and punish/reward students based on performance (though rewards could be automated).

#### 3. Developers/admins

Developers/admins use the software to monitor and collect data. Fix bugs as reported by other users and add additional features.
